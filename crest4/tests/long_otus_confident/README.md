This test contains a dataset created from the sequence data associated to this publication:

* "Confident phylogenetic identification of uncultured prokaryotes through long read amplicon sequencing of the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon."
* Joran Martijn, (_many others_), Thijs Ettema.
* Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University
* https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14636

The raw data of the samples is publicly accessible on the [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA498591).

To create the `consensus.fasta` file that contains OTU clustered sequences (starting from the raw data), the `pacmill` project was used.
