        Args:

            fasta: The path to a single FASTA file as a string.
                   These are the sequences that will be taxonomically
                   classified.

            search_algo: The algorithm used for the sequence similarity search
                         that will be run to match the sequences against the
                         database chosen. Either `blast` or `vsearch`. No
                         other values are currently supported. By default
                         `blast`.

            num_threads: The number of processors to use for the sequence
                         similarity search. By default parallelism is turned
                         off and this value is 1. If you pass the value `True`
                         we will run as many processes as there are CPUs but
                         no more than 32.

            search_db: The database used for the sequence similarity search.
                       Either `silvamod138` or `silvamod128`. No other values
                       are currently supported. By default `silvamod138`.

            output_dir: The directory into which all the classification
                        results will be written to. This defaults to a
                        directory with the same name as the original FASTA
                        file and a `.crest4` suffix appended.

            search_hits: The path where the search results will be stored.
                         This defaults to the output directory. However,
                         if the search operation has already been completed
                         before hand, specify the path here to skip the
                         sequence similarity search step and go directly to
                         the taxonomy step. If a hits file exists in the output
                         directory and this option is not specified, it is
                         deleted and regenerated.

            min_score: The minimum bit-score for a search hit to be considered
                       when using BLAST as the search algorithm. All hits below
                       this score are ignored. When using VSEARCH, this value
                       instead indicates the minimum identity between two
                       sequences for the hit to be considered.
                       The default is `155` for BLAST and `0.75` for VSEARCH.

            score_drop: Determines the range of hits to retain and the range
                        to discard based on a drop in percentage from the score
                        of the best hit. Any hit below the following value:
                        "(100 - score_drop)/100 * best_hit_score" is ignored.
                        By default `2.0`.

            min_smlrty: Determines if the minimum similarity filter is turned
                        on or off. Pass the value `False` to turn it off.
                        The minimum similarity filter prevents classification
                        to higher ranks when a minimum rank-identity is not met.
                        By default `True`.
